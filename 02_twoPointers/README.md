### Dutch National Flag Problem 

Given an array containing three objects, labled as 0, 1 and 2

Sort this array in-place 

- arr = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]
- Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

**Task**:
- Following two-pointers pattern, to solve this problem without any extra space

**Exercise**: [DutchFlag.py](DutchFlag.py)

Time complexity: O(n), n as the length of input array

Space complexity: O(1), no extra space

Constraints:
- 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 2
