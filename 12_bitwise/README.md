### Single Number

Given an array of numbers, **arr**, every numbers appear twice except for one number.

Try to find that single number in **arr**.

- **arr** = [1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3]
- Output: 4

Task:
- With bitwise XOR pattern to design an effeceint solution without extra space

Time complexity: O(n)
- n as all numbers in **arr**

Space complexity: O(1)
- no extra space

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(**arr**) <= 100
- 1 <= arr[i]<= 100
