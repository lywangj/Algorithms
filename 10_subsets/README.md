### Permutations

Given a set of distinct numbers, **nums**, 

find all of its permutations.

- Input: **nums** = [1,3,5]
- Output: [1,3,5], [1,5,3], [3,1,5], [3,5,1], [5,1,3], [5,3,1]

Task:
- Following the Subsets pattern, slove this problem with an efficient approach

Time complexity: O(n*n!)
- n as the length of **nums**
- n! as all the combinations of permutations 
- n for the step to insert a new number in a subset

Space complexity: O(n*n!)

Constraints:
- 1 <= total number of **nums** <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
