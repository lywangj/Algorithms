### 01 Sliding Window

A sliding window pattern will solve this problem in an more effecient way, time complexity O(n)) - n as the size of the given array.
Compared with this, a basic brute force solution will be with time complexity O(n*k) - k as the number of the targeted elements.

- Exercise: Longest Substring without Repeating Characters
- Input string = "bbabcabcdd"
- Output: 4
- Explain: the longest substring w/o repeating characters is "abcd", and the length is 4.
